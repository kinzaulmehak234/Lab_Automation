          </h2>
          <p>
          Lab automation refers to the use of technology to streamline and enhance various laboratory processes. This can include anything from sample handling and data collection to inventory management and workflow coordination. <br>
          Automation is crucial for modern laboratories for several reasons. It enhances efficiency by speeding up repetitive tasks, improves accuracy by reducing human errors, and ensures compliance by providing detailed audit trails. Moreover, it optimizes resource management, facilitates better collaboration, and ultimately contributes to more reliable and reproducible research outcomes.
